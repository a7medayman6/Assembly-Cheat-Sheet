; Arithmetic Operations 

	; dest and src must be same size
	; no memory to memory arithmetic
	inc dest 		; increase dest by 1
	dec dest 		; decrease dest by 1 
	add dest, src	; add src on dest and store in dest
	adc dest, src 		; dest = dest + src + CF
	sub dest, src	; subtract src from dest and store in dest
	neg dest 		; negate dest by finding 2's complement of dest
	; for mul, imul, div, and idiv no immediate values are permitted 
	mul src 		; unsigned multiplication 
					; multiplies 8, 16, or 32-bit operand by AL, AX, or EAX and store it in AX, DX:AX, EDX:EAX 
					; The Carry and Overflow flags are set if upper half of the product is non-zero
	imul src 		; signed multiplication
					; Preserves the sign of the product by sign-extending it
					; multiplies 8, 16, or 32-bit operand by AL, AX, or EAX and store it in AX, DX:AX, EDX:EAX 
					; The Carry and Overflow flags are set if the upper half of the product is not a sign extension of the lower half
	div src  		; unsigned division 
					; divides AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX over 8, 16, or 32-bit operand and store in AL, AX, or EAX the result and in AH, DX, or EDX the reminder
	idiv src 		; signed division
					; Signed integers must be sign-extended before division takes place.
 					; Fill high byte/word/doubleword with a copy of the low byte/word/doubleword's sign bit
					; divides AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX over 8, 16, or 32-bit operand and store in AL, AX, or EAX the result and in AH, DX, or EDX the reminder

; Data transfer

	; No memory to memory
	; Destination cannot be EIP, or IP
	; No immediate value to segment registers
	mov dest, src		; copies src value into dest  ; src and dest must be same size
	movzx dest, src 	; copies src value into dest with zero extension ; dest size must be greater than src size ; fills the rest of the bits with 0's 
	movsx dest, src 	; copies src value into dest with zero extension ; dest size must be greater than src size ; fills the rest of the bits with sign bit 
	xchg dest, src 		; exchange the values of dest and src ; at least one operand must be reg ; dest and src must be the same size ; no immediate operands

; Code Jumping
